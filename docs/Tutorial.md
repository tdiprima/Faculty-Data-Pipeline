Below is an **tutorial** on using the Interfolio/Faculty180 API to get a list of faculty and pull bio info (like names, titles, bios, etc.) from each. I'll keep it short, snappy, and visual with emojis, bullet points, and simple steps. No walls of text! We'll assume you have basic programming skills (e.g., Python) and access to Interfolio/Faculty180 (check your admin for API credentials).

If you're new to APIs, this uses RESTful calls (like fetching web data). Test in a tool like Postman first, then code it. Reference: [Interfolio API Docs](https://product-help.interfolio.com/en_US/technical-resources/about-interfolio-apis-and-documentation) – bookmark it! 🚀

### ⚠️ Quick Warnings Before We Dive In
- **API Access**: You need an Interfolio account with Faculty180 enabled. Contact your institution's admin for API keys/tokens. Not all features are public—some require premium access.
- **Rate Limits**: Don't spam requests—Interfolio might throttle you. Start small!
- **Tools Needed**: Python (with `requests` library), or Postman for testing. Install via `pip install requests`.
- **Ethics**: Only pull data you're authorized for (e.g., your institution's faculty).

### 🛠️ Step 1: Set Up Authentication 🔑
Interfolio uses API keys or OAuth2 for security. (Docs: Check "Authentication" section.)

- ✅ Get your API Key: Log into Interfolio > Go to Admin/Settings > API Integrations > Generate a key (or ask support).
- ✅ For OAuth: If required, use client ID/secret to get a token. Example Python code:

  ```python
  import requests

  url = "https://api.interfolio.com/oauth/token"  # Or your specific endpoint
  payload = {
      'grant_type': 'client_credentials',
      'client_id': 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
      'client_secret': 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
  }
  response = requests.post(url, data=payload)
  token = response.json()['access_token']  # Save this!
  print("Token ready! 🎉", token)
  ```

- 🚨 Test it: If you get a 401 error, your key is wrong. Retry!

### 📋 Step 2: Get a List of Faculty
Use the Faculty180 API endpoint to fetch a list of users (faculty). Endpoint: Something like `/v1/users` or `/faculty` (exact path in docs under "Faculty180 API" > "Users" or "Faculty Search").

- ✅ Base URL: `https://api.interfolio.com/faculty180/` (confirm in docs).
- ✅ Make the Request: Filter by your institution/unit if needed.

  ```python
  headers = {
      'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}',  # From Step 1
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
  params = {
      'unit_id': 'YOUR_UNIT_ID',  # e.g., your department ID
      'limit': 50  # Don't overload—paginate if >50
  }
  response = requests.get("https://api.interfolio.com/faculty180/v1/users", headers=headers, params=params)
  
  if response.status_code == 200:
      faculty_list = response.json()['data']  # Array of faculty objects
      print("Faculty list fetched! 📜", len(faculty_list))
  else:
      print("Oops! Error:", response.status_code)  # Debug time 🐛
  ```

- 🎯 What You Get: A JSON list like `[ { "id": 123, "name": "Dr. Jane Doe", "email": "jane@uni.edu" }, ... ]`. Save the "id" for each faculty!

- 🔄 Pagination Tip: If there are more pages, add `page=2` to params and loop until done. (ADHD hack: Set a timer—don't hyperfocus here!)

### 🔍 Step 3: Pull Bio Info for Each Faculty
For each faculty ID from Step 2, hit a details endpoint like `/v1/users/{id}` or `/faculty/{id}/bio` (check docs under "Faculty Profiles" or "Activity Reporting").

- ✅ Loop Through the List: Fetch bios one by one.

  ```python
  for faculty in faculty_list:
      user_id = faculty['id']
      bio_url = f"https://api.interfolio.com/faculty180/v1/users/{user_id}"  # Or /profile/{id}
      
      bio_response = requests.get(bio_url, headers=headers)  # Reuse headers from Step 2
      
      if bio_response.status_code == 200:
          bio_data = bio_response.json()
          print(f"Bio for {faculty['name']}: 🎓")
          print("Title:", bio_data.get('title', 'N/A'))
          print("Bio Summary:", bio_data.get('biography', 'N/A'))  # Fields vary—check docs!
          print("Publications:", bio_data.get('publications', []))  # Example extra field
      else:
          print(f"Skip {faculty['name']}: Error {bio_response.status_code} 😕")
  ```

- 🎉 What You Get: Details like name, title, bio text, affiliations, publications, etc. (JSON format—easy to save to a file or database).
- 🛡️ Rate Limit Hack: Add `time.sleep(1)` between requests to avoid bans.

### 💾 Step 4: Save & Use the Data
- ✅ Export to CSV: Use Python's `csv` module.

  ```python
  import csv

  with open('faculty_bios.csv', 'w') as file:
      writer = csv.writer(file)
      writer.writerow(['Name', 'Title', 'Bio'])  # Headers
      # Add your loop here to write rows
  ```

- 🚀 Advanced: Store in a database (e.g., SQLite) or visualize with tools like Google Sheets.

### 🆘 Troubleshooting & Tips
- ❌ Common Errors:
  - 401/403: Bad token—redo auth. 🔑
  - 404: Wrong endpoint—double-check docs. 📖
  - 429: Too many requests—slow down! ⏳
- 🌟 ADHD Pro Tips:
  - Break it into 5-min chunks: Auth first, then list, then bios.
  - Use colors in your code editor (e.g., VS Code) for fun.
  - Reward yourself after each step (e.g., ☕ break).
  - Test with 1-2 faculty first—don't overwhelm!
- ❓ Need Help? Interfolio support: Email them via the docs page. Or search "Interfolio API examples" on GitHub for community code.

You did it! 🎊 This should give you a full faculty list + bios. If something's unclear, reply with specifics—I'll tweak it. Go crush that data! 💪
